#Greetings,
# This is a test app mad for evaluation purposes as designated by the employer.

* The app fetches the list of countries using an API and displays them in a drop down menu.
* Clicking on a country will redirect you to that country on the map along with a pin/marker.
* Core Location Framework has been used to display the user's current Location on the map when it first launches.
* The user can choose from muliple map styles.
* The app has been enhanced the app to add a second screen which displays all the countries including the flags.
* Clicking on a country redirects you to the wikipedia page of the country, whose link is also fetched from the api.
* A live search feature has also been added to filter out the countries as you keep typing.
  
# NOTE: There is an issue with the Api. SOmetimes it sucessfully fetches the data from the server and sometimes it fails to fetch
# A alert controller is displayed when such scenario happens and then the app attempts to fetch the data again
